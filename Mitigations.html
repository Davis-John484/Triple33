<h3>Have you everwondered what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life?</h3>

<p>This question is whatthe researchers of one of the worlds most prolonged studies, the Harvard <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI">Study of Adult Development</a>, were trying to answer when they started
their research in 1938. For decades, they tracked the lives of two different
groups of men: Harvard sophomores and a group of boys from Bostons poorest
neighborhoods.</p>

<p>They followed the
lives of these 724 men from their teenage years through their 90s and,
afterward, their childrens lives. Every two years, they asked them to fill out
some questionnaires, interviewed them at home, and even asked for access to
their medical records. In 2015, Robert Waldinger, the fourth director of this
Harvard 75 years study, shared their findings in a TED Talk that went viral.
His most important message:<b><i>having strong social
connections and good relationships keeps us healthier and happier as we go
through life.</i></b></p>

<h3>So, how can we live a happy life?</h3>

<p>It turned out that the best predictor of who
would grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian (someone who reaches age 80) at
age 50 was not their cholesterol levels nor their blood pressure, but how
satisfied they were in their relationships and having strong social
connections. So, they realized that good relationships have a protective effect
on our bodies and also on our brains since people in healthy relationships keep
their memories sharper for longer.</p>

<p>Positive relationships
are as crucial to physical, mental, and emotional well-being as eating healthy,
exercising regularly, or getting enough sleep. Another <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3399889/">landmark study</a> showed that loneliness is a greater risk
to our health than obesity, smoking, or high blood pressure. However, feeling
lonely is always very personal. One can feel lonely while in a group or even in
a long marriage, so the second big lesson is that its not the quantity but the
quality of our relationships that matter for strong connections. In fact, it is
the quality of our relationships that determines the quality of our life.</p>

<h3>Why are strong social
connections so good for our health?</h3>

<p>Studies show that strong social connections
are linked to an increased chance of longevity, a better immune system, less
inflammation, and faster recoveries from disease. When you feel more connected
to others, you are less vulnerable to anxiety and depression and have higher
self-esteem, empathy, and trust toward others. In other words, meaningful
relationships generate a positive social, emotional, and physical well-being
spiral. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true, and those who lack social
connectedness are more prone to suffer a decline in physical and psychological health
and are susceptible to becoming further isolated.</p>

<p>Our brains are hardwired for connection. We
have both a biological and a psychological need for social support. Each time
we genuinely connect with another person, we release the pleasure-inducing hormone
oxytocin into the bloodstream, which reduces anxiety and improves concentration
and focus.</p>

<p>Relationships are crucial for a whole and
fulfilling life. But while most of us know how important relationships are for
our happiness, we do not always live our life in accordance with this
knowledge.</p>

<p>Building strong social connections can
sometimes be challenging because human relationships are complicated and messy.
Tending to family and friends is hard work and an effort that never ends. Some
people find it hard to develop new friendships or keep up with existing ones.
We are absorbed in our everyday life, overwhelmed with work or caring for
children, and relationships can stop being a priority. Due to life changes, one
can even grow apart from their old friends. Maybe youve moved to a new place
and havent yet met new people.</p>

<h3>Making the effort ofhaving strong social connections is totally worth it</h3>

<p >Developing and maintaining good relationships
takes effort, but its absolutely worth it. It is an investment that has the
highest return in terms of what Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar, founder of the Happiness
Studies Academy, calls the ultimate currency, which is happiness. To fulfill
the potential latent in relationships, we need to make them a priority, and we
need to make them real.</p>

<p>Happiness is a product
of our pursuits  the pursuit of those things that make life worth living.
Chris Peterson (1950-2012), one of the founding fathers of Positive Psychology,
when asked what Positive Psychology was all about, used to say: <a
href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-good-life/200806/other-people-matter-two-examples">Otherpeople matter</a> 
Anything that builds
relationships between and among people is going to make you happy.</p>


<p>Therefore, qualitycounts more than quantity. While <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24769739/">research</a> shows that its good to cultivate a
diversified network of friends because of the emotional variety that it
provides us with, its also important to nurture a few truly close friends who
we can deeply trustand rely on.</p>

<h3>What can we do tocultivate meaningful relationships?</h3>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Beproactive  reach out rather than wait for invitations to come your way,
     and do not be discouraged by a negative response. Keep trying. You may
     need to suggest plans a few times before everyone can commit.</li>
 <li>Be
     curious, and ask whats going on in the other persons life. Let them know
     you care, make eye contact, and comments such as, That sounds fun or I
     hear you. Be empathetic, and dont give advice unless the other person
     asks for it.</li>
 <li>Show
     that you can be trusted. Keep your engagements and follow through on
     commitments youve made. When someone shares confidential information with
     you, keep it private.</li>
 <li>Be
     vulnerable. Willingness to disclose personal experiences and concerns
     shows that the other person holds a special place in your life, and this
     builds intimacy and deepens your connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, strong social connections are the
fabric of a good life but unlike love, friends are made rather than found.
Therefore, we must build trust, have common interests and values, and spend
time together if we want to grow meaningful connections.</p>

<h3>We can increase our chances of making new friends by:</h3>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li><p>Joining
     a group or club that gathers around an interestorhobby you
     share.</p></li>
 <li><p>Volunteering
      Sharing a cause worth fighting for or helping others.</p></li>
 <li><p>Practicing
     any team sport, like soccer or basketball.</p></li>
 <li><p>Attending
     social gatherings.</li>
 <li><p>Inviting
     a colleague to join you for coffee or lunch.</p></li>
 <li><p>Going
     for a walk. Chatting with neighbors who are also out or starting
     conversations in the park.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to make social
connections</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Many people think that the new era of social
media is robbing us of meaningful connections with other people. However, we
can still make connections if we use social media beneficially.</p></li>

<li><p>Social media can be a great tool to get in
touch with friends and family members who live outside our neighbourhood or
city. Its also possible to find groups and communities that align with your
interests.</p></li>

<li><p>That said, social media is not without its
criticism. There is growing evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537018300609">heavy social media use
correlates with poorer mental health</a>. And a growing realization of the
 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437119317546"> negative impact that
algorithms have on our ability to access reliable sources</a> of information.</p></li>

<li><p>It can also be worth exploring ways to make
new connections in person. During a pandemic, this can be incredibly difficult,
yet perhaps there are reading groups, sports clubs, cooking collectives, shared
gardens, comedy classes, yoga sessions, walking societies, coding evenings, or
all manner of other activities that could be taking place near where you live.
This might not always be accessible to people, based on the locality, or the
limits of their bodies, so finding similar activities that take place online
can be worth exploring.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Mental health and
social connections</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Physical and mental health <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/45/11/886.short"> are interconnected</a>. When we have good physical health, we may
find that this supports our mental health.</p></li>

<li><p>It is important to keep both aspects of our
wellbeing in mind when making decisions that will affect our quality of life.
Studies have found that people who lack social connections exhibit a higher
risk for mental and physical health problems than those with healthy social
connections ( <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1093/jurban/78.3.458"> source</a>
). In this case, just like with physical
activity, you may decide that it is worth it to invest in your social life,
even if it is a time-consuming activity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So remember, its never too late to build new
relationships or reconnect with old friends. Investing time in making
connections and strengthening your relationships always pays off in terms of the
ultimate currency: happiness.</p>
