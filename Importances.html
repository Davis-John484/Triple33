<h2>Why connections are important for our mental health</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Social connections are more than just
superficial relationships. Friends, family, and even acquaintances provide us
with love, empathy, and understanding in ways that few other things in our
lives can. It has been found that having strong social connections in adulthood
improves mental health by reducing feelings of loneliness, increasing feelings
of self-worth, and providing a sense of belonging. Those with close friends are
less likely to be depressed or anxious.</p></li>

<li><p>The human brain is a social organ. It consists
of cells, called neurons, which either form or receive connections from other
neurons. When we make connections with otherswhether they be friends, family,
mentors, teachers, colleagues, etc.we share information and thoughts that
stimulate new neurological connections in our brains. These new neural
connections appear to promote healthier minds and healthier bodies as well.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Changing society (its not what it used to be)</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>In a society where we are more connected than
ever before thanks to the internet, the question is: Why are social connections
important for our mental health? In a world where we can contact someone from
halfway across the world instantly, shouldnt that mean that the need to feel
socially connect is no longer essential?</p></li>

<li><p>If anything, it has reminded us that it is not
simply the quantity or ease of social connections that matters, but also the
value and quality that we place upon those relationships.</p></li>

<li><p>This doesnt mean that we need to have
physical connections with someone for it to be meaningful. But it probably
means that there is some sort of connection that is established over time,
through our interests, relationships, obligations, and so on. When we think of
social connections, theyre visible in the form of having strong ties within a
community or your social network.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Brain development and social relationships</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Social connections are important for our
mental health because they provide us with vital support that keeps us
mentally, physically, and emotionally healthy.</p></li>

<li><p>Positive social connections can significantly
decrease depression, anxiety, and stress. These negative effects of social
isolation are even more pronounced in children. For instance, research has
found that children who feel neglected or unloved by their parents often
experience developmental issues.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Relationships with others</h2>

<li><p>Relationships with others are important for
our mental health, for both the person who connects with someone and the other
person in the relationship. Social connections can even sometimes be more
significant than food or sleep. Researchers who studied loneliness have found
that it can increase stress, illness, and even death rates. To avoid these
negative outcomes, its essential to find ways to feel socially connected to
other people.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to feel socially connected to others</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>You might experience moments of loneliness or
isolation where you feel that you are disconnected from everyone around you.
When this happens, it can be helpful to take a step back and look at all the
ways in which you are connected to the people around you. You may be connected
through family, friendships, work, and other relationships.</p></li>

<li><p>There are different types of social
interactions. These include but are not limited to:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc class="Examples">
 <li>Family</li>
 <li>Friends</li>
 <li>Colleagues (dont forget ex-colleagues!)</li>
 <li>People you went to school/college/university with</li>
 <li >Group/society members (such as clubs, or places of
     religious practice)</li>
 <li>Neighbours and local community</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Social connections are important for our
mental health because they provide us with a sense of belonging and security.
We often face difficult situations in life and we need others to lean on when
were down, to share in our happiness when were up, and just to be there for
us when we need it most. Finding the time to strengthen your existing
beneficial social connections, and perhaps finding ways to make new ones, can
be an incredible act of self-care.</p></li>
