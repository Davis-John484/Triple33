<h2>Social anxiety disorder</h2>

<p>Socialanxiety disorder(<b>SAD</b>), also known
as <b>social phobia</b>, is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder" title="Anxiety disorder">
anxiety disorder</a> characterized by
sentiments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" title=Fear>
fear</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety" title=Anxiety>
anxiety</a> in social situations, causing
considerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_distress"
title="Mental distress">distress </a> and
impairing ability to function in at least some aspects of daily life.These fears
can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. Individuals with
social anxiety disorder fear negative evaluations from other people.</p>

<p>Physical
symptoms often include excessive <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blushing" title=Blushing>
blushing</a>,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis" title=Hyperhidrosis>
excessive sweating</a>,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor" title=Tremor>
trembling</a>,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitations" title=Palpitations>
palpitations</a>, rapid heartbeat, muscle tension,
shortness of breath, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"
title=Nausea>nausea</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack" title="Panic attack">
Panic attacks</a> can also occur under
intense fear and discomfort. Some affected individuals may use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)" title="Alcohol (drug)">
alcohol</a>or other <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug" title="Psychoactive drug">
drugs</a> to reduce fears and inhibitions at
social events. It is common for those with social phobia to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-medication" title=Self-medication>
self-medicate</a> in this fashion, especially
if they are undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_use_disorder"
title="Alcohol use disorder">alcohol use disorder</a>,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorders" title="Eating disorders">
eating disorders</a>, or other kinds of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"
title="Substance use disorder">substance use
disorders</a>. According to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" title=ICD-10>
ICD-10</a> guidelines, the main diagnostic
criteria of social phobia are fear of being the focus of attention, or fear of
behaving in a way that will be embarrassing or humiliating, avoidance and
anxiety symptoms. Standardized
rating scales can be used to screen for social anxiety disorder and measure the
severity of anxiety.</p>

<p>The first line of treatment for social anxiety disorder is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"
title="Cognitive behavioral therapy">cognitive
behavioral therapy</a> (CBT). CBT is
effective in treating this disorder, whether delivered individually or in a
group setting. The
cognitive and behavioral components seek to change thought patterns and
physical reactions to anxiety-inducing situations.</p>

<p>The
attention given to social anxiety disorder has significantly increased since
1999 with the approval and marketing of drugs for its treatment.<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drugs"
title="Prescription drugs">Prescribed medications</a> include
several classes of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"
title=Antidepressant>antidepressants</a>:<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitors"
title="Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors">selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a>(SSRIs),<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor"
title="Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">serotoninnorepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors</a>(SNRIs), and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors"
title="Monoamine oxidase inhibitors">monoamine
oxidase inhibitors</a> (MAOIs). Other commonly used medications include <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker" title="Beta blocker">
beta blockers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine" title=Benzodiazepine>
benzodiazepines</a>. Medications such as SSRIs are effective for social phobia, such as
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine" title=Paroxetine>paroxetine</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Literary descriptions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness"
title=Shyness>shyness</a> can be traced
back to the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates"
title=Hippocrates>Hippocrates</a> around
400 BC. Hippocrates described someone who through bashfulness, suspicion,
and timorousness, will not be seen abroad; loves darkness as life and cannot
endure the light or to sit in lightsome places; his hat still in his eyes, he
will neither see, nor be seen by his good will. He dare not come in company for
fear he should be misused, disgraced, overshoot himself in gesture or speeches,
or be sick; he thinks every man observes him.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder#cite_note-15"></a></p>

<p>The
first mention of the psychiatric term social phobia (<i>phobie des
situations sociales</i>) was made in the early 1900s. Psychologists
used the term social neurosis to describe extremely shy patients in
the 1930s. After extensive work by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wolpe" title="Joseph Wolpe">
Joseph Wolpe</a> on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization"
title="Systematic desensitization">systematic
desensitization</a>, research on phobias and their treatment grew. The
idea that social phobia was a separate entity from other phobias came from the
British psychiatrist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Marks"
title="Isaac Marks">Isaac Marks</a> in
the 1960s. This was accepted by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association"
title="American Psychiatric Association">American
Psychiatric Association</a> and was first officially included in
the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</p>

<p>After
a call to action by psychiatrist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Liebowitz" title="Michael Liebowitz">
Michael Liebowitz</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychologist"
title="Clinical psychologist">clinical psychologist</a> "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Heimberg" title="Richard Heimberg">
Richard Heimberg</a>", there was an increase in
attention to and research on the disorder. The DSM-IV gave social phobia the
alternative name social anxiety disorder. Research on the
psychology and sociology of everyday social anxiety continued. Cognitive behavioral
models and therapies were developed for social anxiety disorder. In the 1990s,
paroxetine became the first prescription drug in the US approved to treat
social anxiety disorder, with others following.</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>

<p>The
10th version of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Classification_of_Diseases"
title="International Classification of Diseases">International
Classification of Diseases</a>(<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" title=ICD-10>
ICD-10</a>) classifies social anxiety as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder" title="Mental disorder">
mental</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_behavior" title="Abnormal behavior">

title="Disorder (medicine)">disorder</a>.</p>

<h2>Cognitive aspects</h2>

<p>In <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_model" title="Cognitive model">
cognitive models</a> of social anxiety
disorder, those with social phobias experience <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angst" title=Angst>dread</a> over
how they will present to others. They may
feel overly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-conscious"
title=Self-conscious>self-conscious</a>, pay
high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for
themselves. According to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology" title="Social psychology">
social psychology</a> theory of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_management"
title="Impression management">self-presentation</a>,
an affected person attempts to create a well-mannered impression towards others
but believes they are unable to do so. Many times, before the potentially
anxiety-provoking social situation, they may deliberately review what could go
wrong and how to deal with each unexpected case. After the event, they may have
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception" title=Perception>
perception</a>  that they performed
unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will perceive anything that may have
possibly been abnormal as embarrassing. These <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Negative_Thoughts"
title="Automatic Negative Thoughts">thoughts</a> may
extend for weeks or longer.<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion"
title="Cognitive distortion">Cognitive distortions</a> are
a hallmark and are learned about in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy).
Thoughts are often self-defeating and inaccurate. Those with social phobia tend
to interpret neutral or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguous"
title=Ambiguous>ambiguous</a> conversations
with a negative outlook and many studies suggest that socially anxious
individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.</p>

<h2>Behavioral aspects</h2>

<p>Social
anxiety disorder is a persistent fear of one or more situations in which the
person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others and fears that they may do
something or act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing.It exceeds
normal shyness as it leads to excessive social avoidance and
substantial social or occupational impairment.</p>

<p>Those
who have social anxiety disorder fear being judged by others in society. In
particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous in the presence of
people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations.People who
have this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel
embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate
themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel
uncomfortable meeting people they do not know and act distant when they are
with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this
disorder by avoiding eye contact, or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blushing" title=Blushing>
blushing</a> when someone is talking to them.</p>

<h2>Physiological aspects</h2>

<p>Physiological
effects may include excessive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat"
title=Sweat>sweating</a>,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea" title=Nausea>
nausea</a>,<a

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering" title=Shivering>
shaking</a>,<a

palpitations</a>, and increased <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate" title="Heart rate">
heart rate</a>.</p>

<h2>Social aspects</h2>

<p>People
with SAD avoid situations that most people consider normal. People with SAD
avoid all or most social situations and hide from others, which can affect
their personal relationships.Social
phobia can completely remove people from social situations due to the
irrational fear of these situations. People with SAD may be addicted to social
media networks, have <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">
>sleep deprivation</a>, and feel good when they
avoid human interactions.  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder#cite_note-mayo-8"></a>
;SAD can
also lead to low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"
title=Self-esteem>self-esteem</a>, negative
thoughts,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"
title="Major depressive disorder">major depressive
disorder</a>, sensitivity to criticism, and poor social skills that do
not improve. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder#cite_note-mayo-8"></a>
;People with
SAD experience anxiety in a variety of social situations, from important,
meaningful encounters to common situations. These people may feel more nervous
in job interviews, dates, interactions with authority, or at work.

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder#cite_note-21"></a></p>

<h2>Comorbidity</h2>

<p>SAD
shows a high degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"
title=Comorbidity>co-occurrence</a> with
psychiatric disorders. In fact, a population-based study found that 66% of
those with SAD had one or more additional mental health disorders.
SAD often
occurs alongside low self-esteem and most commonly <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression"
title="Clinical depression">clinical depression</a>.Clinical
depression is 1.49 to 3.5 times more likely to occur in those with SAD.Research
also indicates that the presence of certain social fears (e.g., avoidance of
participating in small groups, avoidance of going to a party) are more likely
to trigger comorbid depressive symptoms than other social fears.</p>

<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder" title="Anxiety disorder">
Anxiety disorders</a> other than SAD are also
common in people with SAD, in particular <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder"
title="Generalized anxiety disorder">generalized
anxiety disorder</a>.
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"
title="Avoidant personality disorder">Avoidant
personality disorder</a> is likewise highly correlated with SAD,
with comorbidity rates ranging from 25% to 89%.</p>

<p>To try to reduce their anxiety and alleviate depression, people with social phobia
may use alcohol or other drugs, which can lead to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"
title="Substance use disorder">substance use
disorders</a>. It is estimated that one-fifth of people with social
anxiety disorder also have <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_use_disorder"
title="Alcohol use disorder">alcohol use disorder</a>.
However,
some research suggests SAD is unrelated to, or even protective against
alcohol-related problems. Those who
have both alcohol use disorder and social anxiety disorder are more likely to
avoid group-based treatments and to relapse compared to people who do not have
this combination.</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>Research
into the causes of social anxiety and social phobia is wide-ranging,
encompassing multiple perspectives from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience" title=Neuroscience>
neuroscience</a> to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology" title=Sociology>
sociology</a>. Scientists have yet to pinpoint the
exact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology" title=Etiology>
causes</a>. Studies suggest that genetics can play
a part in combination with environmental factors. Social phobia is not caused
by other mental disorders or substance use. 
Generally, social
anxiety begins at a specific point in an individual's life. This will develop
over time as the person struggles to recover. Eventually, mild social
awkwardness can develop into symptoms of social anxiety or phobia. Passive
social media usage may cause social anxiety in some people.</p>

<h2>Genetics</h2>

<p>It has been shown that there is a two to a threefold greater risk of having social
phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder. This could be due
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" title=Genetics>
genetics</a> and/or due to children acquiring
social fears and avoidance through processes of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_learning"
title="Observational learning">observational
learning</a> or parental <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial" title=Psychosocial>
psychosocial</a> education. Studies of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_twins" title="Identical twins">
identical twins</a> brought up (via <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption" title=Adoption>
adoption</a>) in different families have indicated
that, if one twin developed social anxiety disorder, then the other was between
30 percent and 50 percent more likely than average to also develop the
disorder. To some
extent, this heritability may not be specific  for example,
studies have found that if a parent has any kind of anxiety disorder or
clinical depression, then a child is somewhat more likely to develop an anxiety
disorder or social phobia.Studies
suggest that parents of those with social anxiety disorder tend to be
more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude" title=Solitude>
socially isolated</a> themselves,
<i><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include"
title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">full citation
needed</a></i>
and shyness in adoptive parents
is significantly correlated with shyness in adopted children.
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include"
title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">full citation
needed</a></i></p>

<p>Growing
up with overprotective and hypercritical parents has also been associated with
social anxiety disorder.Adolescents
who were rated as having an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_insecurity"
title="Emotional insecurity">insecure</a> (anxious-ambivalent)
attachment with their mother as infants were twice as likely to develop anxiety
disorders by late adolescence, including social phobia.</p>

<p>A related line of research has investigated '<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Kagan#Temperament"
title="Jerome Kagan">behavioral inhibition</a>'
in infants  early signs of an inhibited and introspective or fearful nature.
Studies have shown that around 1015 percent of individuals show this early
temperament, which appears to be partly due to genetics. Some continue to show
this trait into adolescence and adulthood and appear to be more likely to
develop a social anxiety disorder.</p>

<h2>Social
experiences</h2>

<p>A
previous negative social experience can be a trigger to social phobia,perhaps
particularly for individuals high in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal" title=Interpersonal>
interpersonal</a> sensitivity. For
around half of those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, a specific <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"
title="Psychological trauma">traumatic</a> or
humiliating social event appears to be associated with the onset or worsening
of the disorder;this kind
of event appears to be particularly related to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_social_phobia"
title="Specific social phobia">specific social
phobia</a>, for example, regarding public speaking.
<i><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include"
title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">full citation
needed</a></i>

As well as direct experiences,
observing or hearing about the socially negative experiences of others (e.g. a
faux pas committed by someone), or verbal warnings of social problems and
dangers, may also make the development of a social anxiety disorder more
likely.
Social
anxiety disorder may be caused by the longer-term effects of not fitting in, or
being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullied" title=Bullied>
bullied</a>, rejected, or ignored. Shy
adolescents or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant"
title=Avoidant>avoidant</a> adults have
emphasized unpleasant experiences with peers or
childhood bullying or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment"
title=Harassment>harassment</a>. In one
study, popularity was found to be negatively correlated with social anxiety,
and children who were neglected by their peers reported higher social anxiety
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_negative_evaluation"
title="Fear of negative evaluation">fear of
negative evaluation</a> than other categories of children.Socially
phobic children appear less likely to receive positive reactions from peers,and anxious
or inhibited children may isolate themselves.</p>

<h2>Parental
influences</h2>

<p>Different
parenting styles can also contribute to the development of Social Anxiety
disorder. The common negative parenting styles, such as overcontrol and
criticism can be detrimental for a child to be able to overcome difficult
situations. More aggressive and harsh parenting styles that include both verbal
abuse and physical punishment are linked with an insecure attachment and risk
for Social Anxiety Disorder. On the contrary, positive parenting that fosters a
more supportive and warm environment for the child is correlated to a decreased
risk of developing this disorder.On the
biological level as well, there is strong evidence that states how children
from parents with Social Anxiety Disorder have significantly increased risk to
the disorder.</p>

<h2>Cultural
influences</h2>

<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural" title=Cultural>
Cultural</a> factors that have been related
to social anxiety disorder include a society's attitude towards shyness and
avoidance, affecting the ability to form <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"
title="Interpersonal relationship">relationships</a> or
access employment or education, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame" title=Shame>shame</a>. One study
found that the effects of parenting are different depending on the culture:
American children appear more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if
their parents emphasize the importance of others' opinions and use shame as a
disciplinary strategy, but this
association was not found for Chinese/Chinese-American children. In <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title=China>China</a>,
research has indicated that shy-inhibited children are more accepted than
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group" title="Peer group">
peers</a> and more likely to be considered
for leadership and considered competent, in contrast to the findings in Western
countries.Purely
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic" title=Demographic>
demographic</a> variables may also play a
role.</p>

<p>Problems
in developing social skills, or '<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fluency" title="Social fluency">
social fluency</a>', may be a cause of some social
anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence" title=Confidence>
confidence</a> to interact socially and gain
positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed,
however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills; while
others have.What does
seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be
low. It may be
that the increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming
relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness,
is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the '<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class" title="Middle class">
middle classes</a>'. An
interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal
characteristics has also been argued to fuel <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)"
title="Perfectionism (psychology)">perfectionism</a> and
feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from
others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated
in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.</p>

<h2>Substance-induced</h2>

<p>While <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)" title="Alcohol (drug)">
alcohol</a> initially relieves social phobia,
excessive alcohol misuse can worsen social phobia symptoms and cause panic
disorder to develop or worsen during alcohol intoxication and especially
during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"
title="Alcohol withdrawal syndrome">alcohol
withdrawal syndrome</a>. This effect is not unique to alcohol but can
also occur with long-term use of drugs that have a similar mechanism of action
to alcohol such as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines" title=Benzodiazepines>
benzodiazepines</a> which are sometimes
prescribed as tranquillisers.Benzodiazepines
possess anti-anxiety properties and can be useful for the short-term treatment
of severe anxiety. Like the anticonvulsants, they tend to be mild and
well-tolerated, although there is a risk of habit-forming. Benzodiazepines are
usually administered orally for the treatment of anxiety; however, occasionally
lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack" title="Panic attack">
panic attacks</a></p>

<p>The
World Council of Anxiety does not recommend benzodiazepines for the long-term
treatment of anxiety due to a range of problems associated with long-term use
including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"
title="Drug tolerance">tolerance</a>,
psychomotor impairment, cognitive and memory impairments,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_dependence"
title="Physical dependence">physical dependence</a> and
a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome"

withdrawal syndrome</a> upon discontinuation of benzodiazepines.Despite
increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the
treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic
pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic
effect, and generally favorable side effect profile.Treatment
patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past
decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic
disorder.</p>

<p>Many
people who are addicted to alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines when it is
explained to them they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or
quitting and recovering from their symptoms decide on quitting alcohol or their
benzodiazepines.Symptoms
may temporarily worsen however, during alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine
withdrawal.</p>

<h2>Psychological factors</h2>

<p>Research
has indicated the role of 'core' or 'unconditional' negative <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief" title=Belief>
beliefs</a> (e.g. I am inept) and
'conditional' beliefs nearer to the surface (e.g. If I show myself, I
will be rejected). They are thought to develop based on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality" title=Personality>
personality</a> and adverse experiences and
to be activated when the person feels under threat.Recent
research has also highlighted that conditional beliefs may also be at play
(e.g., If people see I'm anxious, they'll think that I'm weak).</p>

<p>A secondary factor is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concealment" title=Self-concealment>
self-concealment</a> which involves
concealing the expression of one's anxiety or its underlying beliefs. One line of
work has focused more specifically on the key role of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_management"
title="Impression management">self-presentational</a> concerns. The
resulting anxiety states are seen as interfering with social performance and
the ability to concentrate on interaction, which in turn creates more social
problems, which strengthens the negative <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract)" title="Model (abstract)">
schema</a>. Also highlighted has been a high focus
on and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worry" title=Worry>
worry</a> about anxiety symptoms themselves
and how they might appear to others. A similar model emphasizes
the development of a distorted mental representation of the self and
overestimates of the likelihood and consequences of negative evaluation, and of
the performance standards that others have. Such cognitive-behavioral models
consider the role of negatively biased memories of the past and the processes
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumination_(psychology)"

an event also known as post-event processing and
fearful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipation_(emotion)"

it.</p>

<p>Studies
have also highlighted the role of subtle
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidance_coping" title="Avoidance coping">
avoidance</a> and defensive factors, and
shown how attempts to avoid feared negative evaluations or use of safety
behaviors can make
social interaction more difficult and the anxiety worse in the long run. This work
has been influential in the development of cognitive behavioral therapy for
social anxiety disorder, which has been shown to have efficacy.</p>

<p>Social
anxiety disorder is known to appear at an early age in most cases. Fifty
percent of those who develop this disorder have developed it by the age of 11,
and 80% have developed it by age 20.This
early age of onset may lead to people with social anxiety disorder being
particularly vulnerable to depressive illnesses, substance use, and other
psychological conflicts.</p>

<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Comorbidity_Survey"
title="National Comorbidity Survey">National
Comorbidity Survey</a> of over 8,000 American correspondents in
1994 revealed 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of 7.9 percent and 13.3
percent, respectively; this makes it the third most prevalent psychiatric
disorder after depression and alcohol use disorder, and the most common of the
anxiety disorders. According
to US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological"
title=Epidemiological>epidemiological</a> data
from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Mental_Health"
title="National Institute of Mental Health">National
Institute of Mental Health</a>, social phobia affects 15 million adult
Americans in any given year. Estimates
vary within 2 percent and 7 percent of the US adult population.</p>

<p>The
mean onset of social phobia is 10 to 13 years. Onset
after age 25 is rare and is typically preceded by panic disorder or major
depression. Social
anxiety disorder occurs more often in females than males. The
prevalence of social phobia appears to be increasing among white, married, and
well-educated individuals. As a group, those with generalized social phobia are
less likely to graduate from high school and are more likely to rely on
government financial assistance or have poverty-level salaries. Surveys
carried out in 2002 show the youth of
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title=England>
England</a>,<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title=Scotland>
Scotland</a>, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" title=Wales>Wales</a> have
a prevalence rate of 0.4 percent, 1.8 percent, and 0.6 percent, respectively. In
Canada, the prevalence of self-reported social anxiety for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotian" title="Nova Scotian">
Nova Scotians</a> older than 14 years was 4.2
percent in June 2004 with women (4.6 percent) reporting more than men (3.8
percent).In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title=Australia>
Australia</a>, social phobia is the 8th and 5th
leading disease or illness for males and females between 15 and 24 years of age
as of 2003. Because
of the difficulty in separating social phobia from poor social skills or
shyness, some studies have a large range of prevalence. The
table also shows higher prevalence in Sweden.</p>
